Cala Mondrago
=============

This is the two player abstract perfect-information strategy board game Mondrago for HTML5/Javascript/CSS platform.

The project offers the electronical version of the Mondrago board game as originally created and published by Adrian Schacker in 1992. This is a complete rewrite from scratch. It is just reusing my own graphics theme as published at [BoardGameGeek](http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/111396/mondrago) and Adrian Schacker's logo, name, and logo color scheme.

Thank you very much to Adrian kindly supporting our open source project by allowing us to use the original logo, name, and logo color scheme.

See the Mondrago community website for the original rules in text format translated into various languages.
